# SHIP-1_RNA-seq_Pipeline
No SHIP 1, No Chill: RNA-seq Insights into Inflammatory Signaling.
- project overview:
  SHIP1 stands for Src Homology 2 domain-containig Inositol 5-phosphate 1.The gene behind **SHIP 1**, *INPP5D* is mainly expressed in immune cells like microgleia . SHIP1 is consderd as the 
  negetive regulator of immune signaling, by dephosphorylating PIP3 to PIP2 by contracting the PI3k signaling which has a key role in cell survial, proliferation and limiting the pro-inflammatory 
  cytokine production.In this study we conduct a DEG study in WT(wild type) and KO(knock out) microglia samples from mice hipocampouse we found
